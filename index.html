                <h4>Brain Tumor Detection</h4>
                <p>Brain tumor detection is a deep learning model where we have included CNN ad KNN models and also we have used some of the machine learning algorithms like classification and regression and python libraries like keras, tensorflow, cv2 etc. This project will work in such a way that after visiting the website the user must upload an image and it will detect whether it is tumorous or non tumorous. </p>

                    <h5>Multiple Disease Prediction System</h5>
                    <p>Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning model using python. We have used machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, logistic regression etc. We have developed multiple prediction systems like diabetes prediction, heart disease prediction, parkinsons prediction and breast cancer prediction. This project will work in such a way that user must enter all the values like BMI value, age, glucose level etc and it will predict the output as 0 or 1.</p>
